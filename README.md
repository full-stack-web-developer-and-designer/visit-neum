# Tourism Website
This project contains a dynamic responsive website with a complete booking system in one city, where users can directly contact owners of properties such as hotels, apartments, villas, rooms, restaurants, boats, and rent-a-car. Also, the time for the next 7 days and the value of the currency at the exchange rate of NLB Bank are embedded there. There are also created custom 403 and 404 error pages. 

On the home page is embedded the time for the next 7 days, the value of the currency at the NLB Bank exchange rate, and with the help of the LightSlider JavaScript library, object-oriented PHP, and SQL function rand() the properties are displayed randomly each time when home page is opened.

Images on every page for each property are displayed using JavaScript Library Lightbox. They are stored in MySQL database and read using Object Oriented PHP and SQL. 

Each property contains a short description, a location on a Google map, an image gallery displayed with the help of the LightBox JavaScript library, and some properties also contain a video embedded by YouTube.

Also, all properties contain a contact form, which is created on a popup modal created with jQuery. At the same time, all pages contain another popup modal with a contact form for contacting the site administrator.

All forms are validated on the front end using jQuery and on the back end with PHP. If the form is submitted without errors then using JSON and AJAX displays a message that the form is successfully sent. 

With excellent SEO, all properties have improved the site to appear at the top of Google searches.

For faster page loading, all images, CSS and JavaScript code are compressed.
